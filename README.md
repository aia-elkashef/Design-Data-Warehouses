# Design-Data-Warehouses
#### This is the Final-project of Getting Started with Data Warehousing and BI Analytics Course - IBM Data Engineering PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE on Coursera.


The company collects and recycles solid waste across major cities in the country of Brazil. The company operates hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and transport solid waste. The company would like to create a data warehouse so that it can create reports like:

- total waste collected per year per city.

- total waste collected per month per city.

- total waste collected per quarter per city.

- total waste collected per year per truck type.

- total waste collected per truck type per city.

- total waste collected per truck type per station per city.

### The main tasks is:
Task 1: Design the dimension table MyDimDate. 

Task 2: Design the dimension table MyDimWaste. 

Task 3: Design the dimension table MyDimZone. 

Task 4: Design the fact table MyFactTrips. 

Task 5: Create the dimension table MyDimDate. 

Task 6: Create the dimension table MyDimWaste.  

Task 7: Create the dimension table MyDimZone. 

Task 8: Create the fact table MyFactTrips. 

Task 9: Load data into the dimension table DimDate.

Task 10: Load data into the dimension table DimTruck. 

Task 11: Load data into the dimension table DimStation. 

Task 12: Load data into the fact table FactTrips. 

Task 13: Create a grouping sets query.  

Task 14: Create a rollup query.  

Task 15: Create a cube query using the columns year, city, station, average waste collected.

Task 16: Create an MQT named max_waste_per_station using the columns city, station, trucktype, max waste collected.

Task 17: Create a pie chart in the dashboard that shows the waste collected by truck type.
